; Check momfbd config files for bug 228 (see
; https://dubshen.astro.su.se/redmine/issues/228). 
;
; This is a fix to a problem that can affect users who want to make
; fitscubes in workdirs where prepmomfbd was run prior to pulling the
; mid July update of SSTRED.
;
; In that update, I changed some metadata FITS header keywords so they
; would conform with the SOLARNET recommendations. I thought that
; would just propagate through all the processing steps to the final
; fitscubes but I had forgotten that one of those keywords is actually
; accessed by make_nb_cube, and if it (with its new value) is not
; found, some information in the wideband cube is not found.
;
; To fix this, change directory to the CRISP or CHROMIS workdir. Start
; IDL and do
;
; IDL> red_bug228
;
; This program will loop through all momfbd*/.../results/*.fitsheader
; files, find any instances of "PRSTEP1 = 'MOMFBD image restoration'"
; and change them to "PRSTEP1 = 'MOMFBD '".
;
; After this has completed, please make new WB files before making any
; new NB files.
;
; Do *not* run fitscube_finalize on the wideband cube!
