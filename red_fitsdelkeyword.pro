  ;; There is no fxdelpar so we have to use sxdelpar. However,
  ;; sxdelpar is not aware of the OGIP LONGSTRN convention, so if the
  ;; keyword is continued on the next line, the CONTINUE line is not
  ;; removed. So we first make sure the keyword is short, then we
  ;; remove it.

;; Add a long string keyword:
fxaddpar, h, 'TEST', 'A very long string that will need to be continued on the next line using the OGIP LONGSTRN convention.'

;; Remove the keyword with sxdelpar, notice that the CONTINUE line is
