; Old 'hostname -I' doesn't work on La Palma under an old OpenSuSE
; installation therefore the only supported keyword there is -i that gives
; the right IP-address on La Palma but not in Stockholm.  There are more
; robust but less trivial ways to get the IPv4-address of the machine.  As
; for 31 July 2017, the following works:
;   $ ip addr show | grep -Po 'inet \K[\d.]+'
; or
;   $ /sbin/ifconfig -a | grep -Po 't addr:\K[\d.]+'
; Both produce a list of IPv4-addresses for each network interface on La
; Palma as well as in Stockholm.  You can narrow the list to only one
; address by specifying 'ip addr show eth0' or '/sbin/ifconfig eth0' but it
; is better to use full listing as some interfaces might be temporarily off
; the network.
