Action items

* Mats: Pinhole calibration stuff

  - Integrate image scale determination. Need new info from config
    file: pinhole spacing in arcsec. Need the image scale of the crisp
    cameras to propagate into the momfbd config files. Perhaps remove
    from config file and add it to info/metadata.fits? Need to make
    sure pipeline routines know where to look for it.

  - Run Alexander NorÃ©n's code on some more data? We have 6302 data
    (Alexander used 5576) of the same target, needs to be momfbded
    first. Should look also for other data sets with suitable targets.

* Mats: Implement optional post-restoration low-pass filtering. 

  - Two reasons to do this: 1) Remove some unwanted artifacts from
    mosaicking. 2) Reduce false signals in differential quantities. 
  - Base on procedure from tilt-filter paper.

* Olexa: Finish the database handling of metadata and population of
  the database in La Palma. Make sure things still work for users
  without a database or for which the current data does not have
  metadata in the database. Merge into master branch. Test locally for
  a while. Write instructions so users at other sites can set up for
  using a database.

* Mats: Rework the FITS header code. Want final header with keywords
  sorted into groups. Want placement of keywords to work better than
  currently and with long comments working for string-valued keywords
  that are not themselves long. Also want to implement using empty
  lines before END as a buffer to avoid time-wasing changes in the
  header length. So when first initializing the header, specify how
  long you think the header is going to be, eventually.

Implementation list for CHROMIS camera software 2016/06/07

* Online Rice compression of images
* Solution for the 4-bit shift and byte-swapping issues (possibly solved by
  putting the Point Grey into a mode to read-out exactly 12 bits per pixel)
* Solarnet standardized FITS headers:
  - String values in FITS headers must be enclosed by ' ' (a literal ' is
    denoted '') 
  - Boolean values T/F in the correct column (31) without ' '
  - Camera tag in the header as CAMERA/DETECTOR
  - INSTRUME='Chromis'
  - Chromis-N/W/P should have its own keyword. Could be CAMERA, then use
    DETECTOR for camera tag, but possibly we should reserve DETECTOR for
    make, model, sensor info (serial number?), then need to come up with a
    keyword for this. CHANNEL?
  - Camera serial number needs a keyword. What to call it? (Part of DETECTOR?)
  - FILENAME keyword containing the original raw file name.
  - Need a fine-tuning keyword, what to call it?
  - EXPTIME --> XPOSURE
  - OBSRVTRY = 'SST'
  - OBSRVTRY = 'Observtorio del Roque de los Muchachos' ?
  - TELESCOP = 'Swedish 1-meter Solar Telescope'
  - OBSERVER keyword with a standardized list of observer names (enter it once
    into the list and it can't be changed.)
  - units in the comment field (with a space on either side of / separator)
  - EXTNAME = 'Ca II H & K' or 'H-beta'
  - OBS_SHDU =                T (not 1)
  - DATE-BEG,-AVG (for cubes), -END all properly set with fractional second
  - FILTER1 = ['CaK-blue','CaK-core','CaH-core','CaH-red','CaH-cont','Hb-core',
    'Hb-cont','CaHK-cont']
  - DATE_OBS ---> POINT_ID
  - Optional REQUESTR keyword from a standardized name list, if we run in
    service mode.
* Need INTERVAL keyword (--> CADENCE) correct in all camera headers. Currently
  it is only accurate in the master camera header.
* Make sure pre-filter appears in the file name even when the observer isn't
  changing filters or using the filter wheel.
* Placeholder for fine-tuning keyword for Chromis-N will need a Tab-HDU for
  cube files.
