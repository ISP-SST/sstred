Action items


* Make each step in the pipeline write to a log file with (at least)
  the following information: 

  - The moment it was last checked in (and/or it's own version number).
  - How it was called, including keywords and relevant config file information
  - Any useful parameters and numbers calculated from the config file
    info and/or log info downloaded from the observatory web site or elsewhere.


* Pinhole calibration stuff (Mats):

  - Remove dependence on the python script. Do it all from within the
    pipeline IDL session. 
  - Integrate image scale determination. Need new info from config
    file: pinhole spacing in arcsec. Need to output the image scale of
    the crisp cameras in a) the log file and b) the momfbd config files. 
  - Run Alexander's code on some more data. We have 6302 data
    (Alexander used 5576) of the same target, needs to be momfbded
    first. Should look also for other data sets with suitable targets.

* The new flat field procedure (Jaime)
