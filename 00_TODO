Action items


* Make each step in the pipeline write to a log file with (at least)
  the following information: 

  - The moment it was last checked in (and/or it's own version number).
  - How it was called, including keywords and relevant config file information
  - Any useful parameters and numbers calculated from the config file
    info and/or log info downloaded from the observatory web site or elsewhere.


* Pinhole calibration stuff (Mats):

  - Remove dependence on the python script. Do it all from within the
    pipeline IDL session. 
  - Integrate image scale determination. Need new info from config
    file: pinhole spacing in arcsec. Need to output the image scale of
    the crisp cameras in a) the log file and b) the momfbd config files.

* The new flat field procedure (Jaime)
